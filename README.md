# The Downward Fall

* A BATIM: Downward Fall Decompilation

# NOTE

* This decomp was originally meant for a PsVita Port but I decided to take a break from Unity Decomps and shit to go and finish up some ddlc mods I've been working on, ren'py android ports, and last but most importantly my grades lmao.

# Requirements

* Unity 2018 (If you're compiling this for PsVita, you need 2018 with PsVita support downloaded.)

* VS Code

# Credits
